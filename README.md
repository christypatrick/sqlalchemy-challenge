## SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!

Summary: With an upcoming trip to Honolulu, Hawaii, this analysis examines climate data to help with trip planning.  The data consists of precipitation and temperature measurements for 9 weather stations across Hawaii.  The dates I have selected for my trip are 11-06-2016 through 11-09-2016 and align with my birthday celebrations.

### Precipitation Analysis

The precipitation analysis examines the rainfall amount over the last 12 months:

### Station Analysis

The station analysis queries each station to identify the number of stations (9) and determine the station with the highest number of observations.  The following is a histogram of the last 12 months of temperature observations for the most active station:
